# Veggie List with Sveltekit and Pocketbase

## What's inside?

This repo contains an implementation of a test app based on sveltekit and pocketbase. This is a remake of ab old [veggie list repo](https://github.com/st3v3y/veggie-list) I made 3 years ago.

## Why?

We live in a small village at the coast of Ecuador. Every Wednesday our "Veggie Truck" comes to our house to deliver a box of fresh vegetables (and fruits). Because we are very modern here «*cough*», the veggie truck driver receives our order via WhatsApp. So we send him every week a list of all vegetables and fruits we would like to order including their amounts in units, kilograms/grams, pounds or dollars. To make the process of creating this list easier and more exciting for us (and of course to play around with some cool frameworks like Sveltekit and Pocketbase) I decided to create this app. 

I hope you like it and enjoy it. 

### Build

```
cd veggie-list-2025
npm run build
```

### Develop
